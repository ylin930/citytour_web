<h3>Study Information and Statement of Informed Consent</h3>

<p>
    Thank you for your interest in participating in our study on memory development. Please take your time to read this
    text carefully.
</p>

<h3>1. Aim of the Study</h3>
<p>
    This study is a research project of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Development, Berlin, Germany. The
    purpose of this study is to investigate the development of memory capacities across childhood and in adulthood.
</p>

<h3>2. Procedure and Content of the Study</h3>
<p>
    Your child will be asked to complete a simple task that involves watching videos, each providing a guided tour of a
    different magical city. The study consists of three sessions, scheduled 48 to 72 hours (2–3 days) after the previous
    session.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In each session, your child will watch a short city tour video lasting about six minutes and then answer
        questions about the places they saw.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each tour will be followed by three sets of questions, with 12 questions in each set (36 in total per tour).
    </li>
    <li>
        At the end of the third session, your child will answer an additional 84 questions about the two cities visited
        earlier.
    </li>
    <li>Each session is expected to take approximately 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>
        The study should be completed using a laptop computer with a reliable internet connection (no mobile phones or
        tablets).
    </li>
    <li>
        Children are expected to answer the questions independently, without assistance from family or friends. Parents
        may provide help only with technical aspects such as mouse clicks and volume/screen brightness adjustment.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What Will Happen to the Data Collected?</h3>
<p>
    The data collected will be used for research purposes only. The study data will be stored under an individual code
    number. Upon completion of data collection, the individual anonymized code linking the contact data to the task data
    will be deleted, making it impossible to link the study data to you in the future.
</p>
<p>
    The study data may be shared with cooperation partners for collaborative analysis. The study data may also be made
    publicly accessible via research databases (Open Science Framework) or scientific publications (typically via the
    Internet). This allows other researchers to check or replicate the results and enhances the quality of scientific
    research. The study data may also be used for new research questions going beyond the purposes of this particular
    study. Study data are only transferred or made publicly accessible without individualized IDs or any data in which
    persons are identifiable.
</p>

<h3>4. Risks and Compensation for Taking Part in the Study</h3>
<p>There are no known risks involved.</p>
<p>
    This study consists of three sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, for a total of approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.
    Your child will be compensated at a rate of $13 per hour, with an additional $5.75 bonus for completing all three
    sessions, totaling $35.
</p>
<p>
    Each session must be scheduled 48 to 72 hours (2–3 days) after the previous one. Please note that you and your child
    may withdraw from the study at any time. Failure to complete a task within 48–72 hours after the previous session
    will also be considered a withdrawal from the study. In such cases, your child will receive only partial payment
    corresponding to the time they participated:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If your child completes session 1 only: $10 (rounded up from $9.75).</li>
    <li>If your child completes sessions 1 and 2: $20 (rounded up from $19.50).</li>
    <li>If your child quits mid-session, payment will be proportional to completed time in 30-minute increments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of the study, you will receive a virtual Amazon gift card sent to your email with the amount depending on
    partial or complete participation.
</p>

<h3>5. Legal Basis</h3>
<p>
    The legal basis for the processing of your data is your consent, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR. You

    processing and use of your data at any time without negative consequences. Please note that once the code list has
    been deleted, it is no longer possible to link your browser-based task entrance code to your study data.
