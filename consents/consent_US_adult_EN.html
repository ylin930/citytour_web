<h3>Study Information and Statement of Informed Consent</h3>

<p>
  Thank you for your interest in participating in our study on memory development. Please take your time to read this
  text carefully.
</p>

<h3>1. Aim of the study</h3>
<p>
  This study is a research project of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Development, Berlin, Germany. The purpose
  of this study is to investigate the development of memory capacities across childhood and in adulthood.
</p>

<h3>2. Procedure and content of the study</h3>
<p>
  You will be asked to complete a simple task that involves watching videos, each providing a guided tour of a different
  magical city. The study consists of three sessions, scheduled 48 to 72 hours (2–3 days) after the previous session.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In each session, you will watch a short city tour video lasting about six minutes and then answer questions about
    the places you saw.
  </li>
  <li>Each tour will be followed by three sets of questions, with 12 questions in each set (36 in total per tour).</li>
  <li>
    At the end of the third session, you will answer an additional 84 questions about the two cities visited earlier.
  </li>
  <li>Each session is expected to take approximately 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>
    The study should be completed using a laptop with a reliable internet connection (no mobile phones or tablets).
  </li>
  <li>You are expected to answer the questions independently, without assistance from family or friends.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What will happen to the data collected?</h3>
<p>
  The data collected will be used for research purposes only. The study data will be stored under an individual code
  number. Upon completion of data collection, the individual anonymized code linking the contact data to the task data
  will be deleted, making it impossible to link the study data to you in the future. The study data may be shared with
  cooperation partners for collaborative analysis. The study data may also be made publicly accessible via research
  databases (Open Science Framework) or scientific publications (typically via the Internet). This enables other
  researchers to check or replicate the results and enhances the quality of scientific research. The study data may also
  be used for new research questions going beyond the purposes of this particular study. Study data are only transferred
  or made publicly accessible without individualized IDs or any data in which persons are identifiable.
</p>

<h3>4. Risks and compensation for taking part in the study</h3>
<p>There are no known risks involved.</p>
<p>
  This study consists of three sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, for a total of approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.
  You will be compensated at a rate of $13 per hour, with an additional $5.75 bonus for completing all three sessions,
  totaling $35. Each session must be scheduled 48 to 72 hours (2–3 days) after the previous one. Please note that you
  may withdraw from the study at any time. Failure to complete a task within 48–72 hours (2–3 days) after the previous
  session will also be considered a withdrawal from the study. In such cases, you will receive only partial payment
  corresponding to the time you participated. For example, if you complete session 1 but not sessions 2 and 3, you will
  be compensated with $10 (rounding up from $9.75 for 45-minute-long participation). If you complete sessions 1 and 2
  but not session 3, you will be compensated with $20 (rounding up from $19.50 for 90-minute-long participation). If you
  quit the task mid-session, you will be paid proportionally to the time you have completed for each 30-minute
  increment. At the end of the study, you will receive a virtual Amazon gift card sent to your email with the amount
  depending on partial or complete participation.
</p>

<h3>5. Legal basis</h3>
<p>
  The legal basis for the processing of your data is your consent, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR. You
  may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. You may also withdraw your consent to the processing
  and use of your data at any time without negative consequences. Please note that once the code list has been deleted,
  it is no longer possible to link your browser-based task entrance code to your study data.
