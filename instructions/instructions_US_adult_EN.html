<h3>Dear Participant,</h3>

<p>Please carefully read the following instructions. Your cooperation is essential for advancing the science of memory development.</p>

<h3>Before beginning the study, please:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Maximize the browser window to full screen.</li>
  <li>Ensure you are seated comfortably and facing the computer screen.</li>
  <li>Set your computer brightness to a comfortable level (brighter is better).</li>
  <li>Adjust the volume to a comfortable level (there will be audio in the animations).</li>
  <li>Make sure the environment is quiet and free from distractions for the entire session (about 45 minutes).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Study Procedure:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First, you will watch an animation for approximately 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, you will answer questions about what you saw. Each question will show three answer choices, displayed from left to right at the bottom of the screen.</li>
  <li>Use the mouse to click on the image that corresponds to your choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The key goal of our research is that you watch attentively and answer all questions independently.</li>
  <li>You can take a short break (up to 5 minutes) between subtasks within each session (3 breaks in sessions 1 and 2, and 5 in session 3).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Exiting full screen during the session or not completing the study within 48â€“72 hours after the previous session will be considered a withdrawal from the experiment.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your support! Your participation is essential to the progress of our research on memory development.</p>
